Readme for CS50 Final Project, 4/2014

This project is a simple arithmetical training game originally designed for grade school
level children, but difficulties for adults are now available as well.  Users can register
accounts and save their high scores, or play without registering just for fun.  The numbers 
and mathematical expressions are randomly generated based on the difficulty the user selects.
